       "what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n",

       "\n",
       "Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \"I wonder how\n",

       "somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four\n",

       "was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as\n",
       "there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it\n",
       "over) \"--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what\n",
       "Latitude or Longitude I've got to?\" (Alice had no idea what Latitude\n",

       "say.)\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently she began again. \"I wonder if I shall fall right _through_ the\n",

       "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
       "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
       "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",

       "called out as loud as she could, \"If you do, I'll set Dinah at you!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself \"I\n",

       "Alice heard the Rabbit say \"A barrowful will do, to begin with.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. But she had not long to doubt,\n",
       "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",

       "head. \"If I eat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make\n",
       "_some_ change in my size; and, as it can't possibly make me larger, it\n",
       "must make me smaller, I suppose.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
       "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\n",
       "the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\n",
       "animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in\n",
       "the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
       "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",
       "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
       "safe in a thick wood.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as she wandered\n",
       "about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the second\n",
       "thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be\n",
       "the best plan.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
       "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
       "how to set about it; and, while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
       "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
       "great hurry.\n",
       "\n",
       "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
       "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \"Poor little\n",
       "thing!\" said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\n",
       "it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\n",
       "might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\n",
       "spite of all her coaxing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
       "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
       "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
       "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
       "to keep herself from being run over; and, the moment she appeared on the\n",
       "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
       "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\n",
       "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
       "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
       "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a little\n",
       "way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the\n",
       "while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its\n",
       "tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
       "\n",
       "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
       "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and\n",
       "till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And yet what a dear little puppy it was!\" said Alice, as she leant\n",
       "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
       "leaves. \"I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd\n",
